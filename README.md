# EmailValidation

## What is EmailValidation?

A simple (but correct) .NET class for validating email addresses.

Supports Internationalized Mail Address standards (rfc653x).

## Installing via NuGet

The easiest way to install EmailValidation is via [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/EmailValidation/).

In Visual Studio's [Package Manager Console](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/start-here/using-the-package-manager-console),
enter the following command:

    Install-Package EmailValidation

## Getting the Source Code

First, you'll need to clone EmailValidation from my GitHub repository. To do this using the command-line version of
Git, you'll need to issue the following command in your terminal:

    git clone https://github.com/jstedfast/EmailValidation.git

If you are using [TortoiseGit](https://tortoisegit.org) on Windows, you'll need to right-click in the directory where
where you'd like to clone EmailValidation and select **Git Clone...** in the menu. Once you do that, you'll get a
dialog asking you to specify the repository you'd like to clone. In the textbox labeled **URL:**, enter
`https://github.com/jstedfast/EmailValidation.git` and then click **OK**. This will clone EmailValidation onto your
local machine.

## Updating the Source Code

Occasionally you might want to update your local copy of the source code if I have made changes to EmailValidation
since you downloaded the source code in the step above. To do this using the command-line version fo Git, you'll
need to issue the following command in your terminal within the EmailValidation directory:

    git pull

If you are using [TortoiseGit](https://tortoisegit.org) on Windows, you'll need to right-click on the EmailValidation
directory and select **Git Sync...** in the menu. Once you do that, you'll need to click the **Pull** button.

## Building

Open the **EmailValidation.sln** solution file in [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/),
choose the desired build configuration (**Debug** or **Release**) and then build.

Note: The **Release** build will generate the xml API documentation, but the **Debug** build will not.

## Using EmailValidation

This is quite possibly the easiest API ever to use. There is simply 1 class with 1 method.

```csharp
using System;

using EmailValidation;

namespace Example {
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main ()
        {
            do {
                Console.Write ("Enter an email address: ");

                var input = Console.ReadLine ();
                if (input == null)
                    break;

                input = input.Trim ();
                Console.WriteLine ("{0} is {1}!", input, EmailValidator.Validate (input) ? "valid" : "invalid");
            } while (true);

            Console.WriteLine ();
        }
    }
}
```
