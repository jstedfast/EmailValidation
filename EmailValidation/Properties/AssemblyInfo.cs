// General Information about an assembly is controlled through the following
// set of attributes. Change these attribute values to modify the information
// associated with an assembly.

// Version information for an assembly consists of the following four values:
//
//      Major Version
//      Minor Version
//      Micro Version
//      Build Number
//
// You can specify all the values or you can default the Build and Revision Numbers
// by using the '*' as shown below:
// [assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.0.*")]
//
// Note: AssemblyVersion is what the CLR matches against at runtime, so be careful
// about updating it. The AssemblyFileVersion is the official release version while
// the AssemblyInformationalVersion is just used as a display version.
//
// Based on my current understanding, AssemblyVersion is essentially the "API Version"
// and so should only be updated when the API changes. The other 2 Version attributes
// represent the "Release Version".
//
// Making releases:
//
// If any classes, methods, or enum values have been added, bump the Micro Version
//    in all version attributes and set the Build Number back to 0.
//
// If there have only been bug fixes, bump the Micro Version and/or the Build Number
//    in the AssemblyFileVersion attribute.
[assembly: AssemblyInformationalVersion ("1.3.0")]
[assembly: AssemblyFileVersion ("1.3.0")]
[assembly: AssemblyVersion ("1.3.0.0")]
